# CNN for Vehicle Detection

In this project, we are going to go through the procedure of building a Convolutional neural network for Vehicle detection by: 
<li>Choosing the suitable CNN architecture</li> 
<li>Tackling overfitting using data augmentation</li>
<li>Using [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) (**Transfer Learning**), a pre-trained on [ImageNet competition](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)</li>
<li>Visualizing the learned features</li>
