# CNN for Vehicle Detection

In this project, we are going to go through the procedure of building a Convolutional neural network for Vehicle detection by: 
- Choosing the suitable CNN architecture.
- Tackling overfitting using data augmentation.
- Using [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) for **Transfer Learning** (a pre-trained CNN on [ImageNet competition](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)).
- Visualizing the learned features.
